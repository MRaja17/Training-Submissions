# Easy 1: Key Concepts of Advanced SQL Joins & Aggregations

### ⭐ What are JOINS?
JOINS allow us to combine rows from two or more tables using a related column (e.g., customer_id).

### Types of Joins:
- **INNER JOIN** → returns only matching rows in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** → returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN** → returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** → returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.
- **CROSS JOIN** → produces a cartesian product of both tables.

### What are Aggregations?
Aggregations summarize data using functions like:
- **COUNT()**
- **SUM()**
- **AVG()**
- **MIN()**
- **MAX()**

### GROUP BY  
Used when applying an aggregation to each group.

### HAVING  
Used to filter aggregated results (cannot use WHERE after GROUP BY).

This covers the foundational ideas needed for advanced SQL joins & aggregations.
